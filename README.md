## Building a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### About the project 

In this project, I built a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is simple to play, users can choose between rock, paper and scissors by clicking on the corresponding button. The computer also makes a choice and the winner is displayed on the screen. I used JavaScript to create the logic of the game and determine the winner, while HTML and CSS were used to create the layout and design of the game. The game is interactive and responsive, making it easy to play on any device. Overall, this project helped me to improve my skills in web development and gain a deeper understanding of how the different technologies work together.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, building this game was challenging, particularly the JavaScript component which required extensive research and understanding of conditionals and DOM manipulation. Despite this, the hard work paid off and I am proud of the final result.
